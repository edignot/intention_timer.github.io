### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

- To improve initial planning and organization of a project.

- Splitting tasks evenly and setting small goals that will add up to the completion of the project.
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
- Keeping communication flexible will be good, keeping it open will be beneficial but not over-doing it.
* How would you describe your work style?
- Both self-directed workers.
* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
- Organized, timely,

- We managed time well.
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
- We will use Trello and slack to stay organized and keep communication open.
* How will we overcome obstacles?
- If we run into a problem that we can't solve in a timely manner, we will communicate and try and solve it together.
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
- A quiet space, time to work and study and understand concepts on our own.
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
- We're pretty flexible.
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
- As a team, we have some exposure to Javascript and we are comfortable in CSS and HTML.  We need to improve our comfort Javascript.
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
- Trello, github, slack, and atom.
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
- If a problem comes up that one group member cannot solve then, be sure to not spend too much time on it if there is no progress being made.  Instead, communicate to the other team member and use slack to ask other class memebers.
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
